# Home-Credit-Indonesia---Rakamin-Virtual-Interhsip

This is my final project on Rakamin Virtual Internship with Home Credit Indonesia. In this project, I was doing some data analysis and making some Machine Learning models, such as Logistic Regression and K-Nearest Neighbor to help predict credit scores of each HCI client. 

You can see the code on the .ipynb file that I had uploaded on this repository.
